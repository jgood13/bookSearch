# bookSearch

## Description

This is a book search application that I changed the server to run redux with state. It is mostly working locally. I can't get sign up to work or the deployment to work. I feel I'm very close but health issues are coming in the way of me and this challenge. I changed the server/server.js to get it from apollo, I created a server/schemas folder where I put an index.js file to call on both the resolvers and the typeDefs, I also changed the client app.js file, and in the utils I created a mutations.js and queries.js file to handle the front end mutations and queries. I added a bunch in the login and signup form as well as the savedbooks.js and searbooks.js to try to get everything working. Unfortunately I came up short but I will get back to this in the coming week when I'm not dealing with the same issues.
